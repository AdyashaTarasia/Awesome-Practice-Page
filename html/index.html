                        <h3>Sweet Couple</h3>
                        <p>No matter if you're 20 years old or 60, we have all done our fair share of cheesy things for our significant other. From diabetes inducing social media posts to everyday phone calls that end up with "You hang up first. No, you hang up first. Okay, we'll hang up together." As awww-dorable as they sound, we get it when you say that it can get pretty annoying. Right? Read on to see what cute yet annoying things sweet couples do when they're in love.</p>

                        <h3>The True Friend</h3>
                        <p>To put it simply, dogs are awesome. Whether theyâ€™re begging for your food, barking at their leash to convince you to take them on a walk, or simply greeting you when you get home, dogs do all of the little things that put smiles on faces around the world.Intelligence varies depending on the kind of breed you get, but overall, dogs are some of the most intuitive animals around. This is demonstrated by their multiple facial expressions (I especially like the one where they tilt their head and look at you quizzically), their ability to deviously hide toys in the strangest of places, and more.</p>

                        <h3>Importance of Being Social</h3>
                        <p>An active social life can boost your immune system and improve your nutrition, since you tend to eat more when you're around others. Being social can lower your blood pressure and potentially reduce the symptoms of depression. As you can see, social activity is vital to seniors for their health and mental well-being.</p>
